# LSTM-CRF-pytorch-faster
This is an accelerated LSTM-CRF implementation based on the Pytorch official tutorial   (URL:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html). I have modified the dynamic planning part, including Viterbi decoding and partition function calculation. In the experiment, it has achieved a speed increase of more than 50 times compared to the original version.
