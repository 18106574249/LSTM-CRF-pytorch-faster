# LSTM-CRF-pytorch-faster
This is an LSTM-CRF implementation optimized from the Pytorch official document. I have modified the dynamic planning part, including Viterbi decoding and partition function calculation. In the experiment, it has achieved a speed increase of more than 50 times compared to the original version.
